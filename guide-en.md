So you decided to use your mic on your stream! Which would be very helpful toward making the stream more interactive, as generally it's more fun and joyful watching someone playing games when you can hear what they think via their voice!

But one thing, your viewers are supposed to hear your voice and **all kind of other noises**, and it's hard to stay in your stream if the noises are too interrupting to watch your stream.

There are 4 audio filters I will explain, that will drastically improve your overall audio, and if you are done setting your basic configuration for them, it will be easier to make change when someone tells you there's an issue with your audio.

Before going into the explanation, I want to tell you that all these filters can also be applied to any of your audio sources, including Desktop Audio. And the filters can improve these audio sources in the same way they can improve your voice.

# Table of Contents

- Is there static noise around you?  
  Try [Noise Suppression](#noise-suppression) and [Noise Gate](#noise-gate).
- Your voice is sometimes too loud, and sometimes too quite?  
  Try [Compressor](#compressor) and [Gain](#gain).
- Worried about your voice maxing out and distort when you scream?  
  Try [Limiter](#limiter).

Okay, so you're all set up with audio configuration! It should be good for now, but as time goes there should be always someone who's gonna point out an issue with your audio setting. It could be a viewer, or you yourself!
